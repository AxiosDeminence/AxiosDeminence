# Projects
* Pomodoro Timer: Inherited an existing project and applied design patterns to refactor an existing codebase. Explored the time management domain and pomodoro technique in order to understand the problem to target areas of improvement.
* Roleplay Dice Scraper: Designed a web scraper using node.js to export records to a DSV format. Developed a native add-on that leverages an existing C library to improve performance of querying the next required record.
* Portfolio Website: Used Eleventy to statically generate a website to showcase different projects. Leveraged Lit and Vite to reduce page load times.
* Meeting Time Recommender: Led a team of four developers to deliver a native Android app to coordinate user schedules for meetings. Created a PostgreSQL database and RESTful API to handle groups and suggest meeting times.
* Scalable Database: Devised a protocol to scale storage across multiple servers to increase service resiliency. Deployed consistent hashing to allow for the addition and removal of nodes without disrupting the service.
